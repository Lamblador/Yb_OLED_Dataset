# Ytterbium based OLED dataset
This repository contain ytterbium based organic light-emitting diode dataset with data of emitter material used, OLED performance and material characteristics. 
LightAutoML regression was used to predict EQE, ECE and Max. Irradiance of the OLED.

Work done by Koshelev Daniil from Faculty of the Material Sciecne, Lomonosov MSU (Moscow, Russia).
