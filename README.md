# Ytterbium based OLED dataset
This repository contain ytterbium based organic light-emitting diode dataset with data of emitter material used, OLED performance and material characteristics. 
LightAutoML regression was used to predict EQE, ECE or Uon and Max. Irradiance of the Yb based OLED.

All data was found in the literature. References to the source papers is in the manuscript, described the work. Reference will be here.

Dataset .csv file was prepared in human readble (yb_oled_data.xlsx) and machine readble forms (yb_oled_data_short_ML.csv).

Work done by Koshelev Daniil from Faculty of the Material Sciecne, Lomonosov MSU (Moscow, Russia).
